To structured our application, simple routing, and support for Connect middleware, allowing many extensions and useful features, we have used Express framework. 
Please follow below steps to create project and install express module as a dependency.

For example

```js
mkdir expressapp
cd expressapp
npm init
entry point: (index.js) app.js
npm install express --save
```
In the expressapp directory, create a file named app.js and add the following code:

```js
var express = require('express');
var app = express();

app.get('/', function (req, res) {
  res.send('welcome to home page!');
});

app.get('/about', function (req, res) {
  res.send('welcome to about page!');
});

app.listen(9000, function () {
  console.log('Example app listening on port 9000!');
});
```
The app starts a server and listens on port 3000 for connections. The app responds with “welcome to home page!” for requests to the root URL (/) or route and responds with “welcome to about page!” for requests to the root URL (/about) or route. For every other path, it will respond with a 404 Not Found. Run the app with the following command:

```js
node app.js
```
Then, load http://localhost:9000/ in a browser to see the output.
Feel free to download the full code for this post to see the full picture of how everything works together and customize it for your own needs. Have a look at the repository for complete working code.

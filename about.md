Hi, I am Madhu, welcome to my site! I am a Freelance Full stack Programmer and a UX Designer currently living in the Netherlands. I love travelling and people. I like to work on stuff that creates an impact in the society we live in.

## What do I do?

I help startups to build scalable businesses, communities and applications using web and mobile technologies.

## How do I do it?

1. _Brainstorm_ ideas with product owners, come up with user stories.
2. _Sketch_ the ideas on a whiteboard to come up with the _user flows_ and think it out loud. At this phase I prefer to include the _team_ that is involved as it brings _alignment_. (I sometimes use parts of [google design sprint](http://designsprintkit.withgoogle.com) here).
3. _Design_ using SketchApp (if needed)
4. _Code_ it!

I use JavaScript and [Open Source Software](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open-source_software) (OSS) to implement the solutions. Here's the tech stack I prefer to use: React, React-Native, Node.js and MongoDB.

I not only use OSS to build solutions, but also contribute back. Checkout my github to see my contributions.

If what I do intrigues you, whether it's a completely new idea or an already existing application, drop me a line and I shall get back to you!

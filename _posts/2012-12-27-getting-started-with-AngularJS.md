I wrote a blog [post](http://madhums.me/2012/10/02/trade-offs-of-purely-client-side-development-approach/) couple of days back about the pain I was facing in developing client side web apps (with backbone). I tried angular and it tries to solve the problems I was having.

As I elaborated in my previous post, the biggest issue (with backbone) was wiring these single components and to make them work together, angular solves this using dependency injection and data binding. It's a win (for me).

I was looking for something which

1. increases productivity
2. reduces the code and hence easier to maintain
3. follows conventions
4. gives you separation of concerns
5. follows test first approach

I sat for two days and I went through series of videos and blog posts, I am listing them here.

I started with the [tutorial](http://docs.angularjs.org/tutorial) and parallelly I watched/read the above links. Also the documentation is good enough to help you through. There are some nice [examples](https://github.com/angular/angular.js/wiki/JsFiddle-Examples) you can play around with.

Angular also comes with a [boilerplate (angular-seed)](https://github.com/angular/angular-seed), just for YOU!

If you are not happy with how backbone is working out for you, you should seriously give it a try.

To structured our application, simple routing, and support for Connect middleware, allowing many extensions and useful features, we have used Express framework. 
First, create a directory named "expressapp", change to it, and run npm init. Then install express as a dependency.

For example

```js
mkdir expressapp
cd expressapp
npm init
entry point: (index.js) app.js
npm install express --save
```
In the expressapp directory, create a file named app.js and add the following code:

```js
var express = require('express');
var app = express();

app.get('/', function (req, res) {
  res.send('welcome to home page!');
});

app.get('/about', function (req, res) {
  res.send('welcome to about page!');
});

app.listen(9000, function () {
  console.log('Example app listening on port 9000!');
});
```
The app starts a server and listens on port 3000 for connections. The app responds with “welcome to home page!” for requests to the root URL (/) or route and responds with “welcome to about page!” for requests to the root URL (/about) or route. For every other path, it will respond with a 404 Not Found. Run the app with the following command:

```js
node app.js
```
Then, load http://localhost:9000/ in a browser to see the output.
